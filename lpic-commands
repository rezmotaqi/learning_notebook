commands


1. in GRUB 
	passing 1 or S results to system to be loaded in single mode user or recovery 		mode. 
	paasing vga=762 results to force your graphics to work in 1024Ã—768x24 mode.

2. dmesg: shows full log data from kernel buffer ring
3. cat /var/log/dmesg shows kernel log during boot

4.journalctl -k: shows kernel log data
5.journalctl -b: sows boot log data
6.journalctl -u: kernel shows boot logs from including previous logs too

7. readlink: shows the target of the symlink
	readlink /usr/sbin/init
		../lib/systemd/systemd

	(symbolic link, is a type of file that points to another file or directory - 		like a shortcut)

8. which: finds the location of the executable that command runs which is set in
	PATH 
	which init
		/usr/sbin/init
9. ps: list of processes. (ps is short for process status)
	ps -p 1234: shows information of process with pid=1234
	ps -C sshd: shows information of process using command name sshd
	ps aux: shows detailed information about all processes
	it has other arguments too.


10. The systemd is made around units. A unit can be a service, group of services,or 	an action. Units do have a name, a type, and a configuration file. There are 12 	unit types: automount, device, mount, path, scope, service, slice, snapshot, 		socket, swap, target & timer.

	We use systemctl to work with these units and journalctl to see the logs.

	systemctl list-units
	systemctl list-units --type=target
	systemctl get-default # default target (groups of services are started via target unit files)

	The units can be found in these places (sorted by priority):

	/etc/systemd/system/
	/run/systemd/system/
	/usr/lib/systemd/system



	We can use these commands to work with services:

		systemctl stop sshd
		systemctl start sshd
		systemctl status sshd
		systemctl is-active sshds
		systemctl is-failed sshd
		systemctl restart sshd
		systemctl reload sshd # re-reads the configuration of the service configs
		systemctl daemon-reload sshd # re-reads the configuration of the systemd 		configs of this service
		systemctl enable ssh
		systemctl disable sshd
		systemctl is-system-running # running, degraded, maintenance, initializing,		starting, stopping

		systemctl --failed


	to check the logs, we have to use the journalctl utility:

		journalctl # show all journal ==>> shift + g = goes to the end of the log
		journalctl --no-pager # do not use less
		journalctl -n 10 # only 10 lines
		journalctl -S -1d # last 1 day
		journalctl -xe # last few logs
		journalctl -u ntp # only ntp unit
		journalctl _PID=1234



11. systmectl list-unit-files: show list of unit files.

		4 unit examples:

		UNIT FILE: This column lists the name of the unit file. Each unit file 		defines a specific type of resource that systemd manages

		STATE:
			enabled: The unit is enabled, meaning it is set to start automatically 		on boot.

			disabled: The unit is disabled, meaning it will not start 				automatically on boot, but can be started manually.


		PRESET: This column indicates the preset status of the unit, showing		whether the service is preset to be enabled or disabled by default in 	  the system configuration. The possible values are:

			enabled: The unit is preset to start automatically on boot.

			disabled: The unit is preset to not start automatically.

			-: No preset is defined for this unit, meaning the system has no 		default configuration for whether it should be enabled or disabled.


		UNIT FILE                                     STATE           PRESET  
		proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.automount             static          -       
		run-vmblock\x2dfuse.mount                     disabled        disabled
		cups.path                                     enabled         enabled 
		ostree-finalize-staged.path                   disabled        enabled 


12. systemctl cat ntpd.service: shows the unit file.
