1. To exclude a directory from being check for pytest coverage create a .coveragerc file with this content

   .coveragerc
   --------------
    [run]
    source = app/endpoints

    [report]
    omit =
        */tests/*
        */core/*
        */models/*
        */schemas/*
        */handlers/*
        main.py
        routers.py


    for example in the above file, the directories and files listed under omit are excluded from being checked for pytest coverage.


    a command which checks the directory passed as --cov arg and because of --cov-report=term-missing prints the result in stdout :

        `pytest --cov=app/endpoints --cov-report=term-missing`. It shows the result in stdout.
