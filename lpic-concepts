1. symlink:


	A symlink, or symbolic link, is a type of file in Unix-like operating systems that points to another file or directory. It functions as a shortcut or reference, allowing you to access the target file or directory via a different path.

		ln -s /home/user/file.txt /home/user/Desktop/file_link.txt
